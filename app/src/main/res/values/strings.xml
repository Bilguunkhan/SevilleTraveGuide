    <string name="alcazar1">Architecture is not just about the development of a design style or how to build a bridge that works effectively.   Architecture is a universal art that affects everyone.  It has the power to create icons that can shape and define our world.   Often, architectural design incorporates cultural influences.  The Royal Alcázar of Seville in Spain is one such example, and one of my favorites.  ‘Alcázar’ comes from the Hispano-Arabic word ‘Alqáşr’ meaning ‘Royal House.’</string>
